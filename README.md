# Length of the challenge:
The coding challenging took me about 3-4 hours. The bonus points (Testing) took considerably more
time and is where I got really stuck. Had I not attepted it I would have taken about 2 hours to complete
the challenge.

The reason it took me longer with the test was, since Darts null safety introdcution a lot of packages got affect with the changes, specifically 
the Mockito package (https://pub.dev/packages/mockito) i was using to implement Mocks for testing 
the apis and classes. This wasn't really challenging but I had to dig into the changes and new was of implementing tests which to some time
to learn and understand.
